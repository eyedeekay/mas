  Make a Site/Makefile Abuse Stopper: Just generate a site, as simply as possible.

<p class="README">
  This is the world’s simplest static site generator. Maybe. Maybe that’s an
  overstatement. What it is for sure is super damned simple. You give it a
  directory, which is full of files. If any of those directories contain
  <code>
    .md
  </code>
  files, they are processed in alphabetical order and turned into a single
  index.html page. The general idea is “One directory, one page.” HTML is allowed
  in the markdown files as well.
</p>
<p class="README">
  Anything in the ./css ./js or ./images folder is copied directly to the root of
  the site, and all Javascript and CSS is shared by all generated pages.
</p>
<p class="README">
  The output of these processes, page generation and static file preparation, is
  eventually placed in the ./site directory, which you can copy to any web server.
